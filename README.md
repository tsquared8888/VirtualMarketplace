# VirtualMarketplace

This project was a school project developed by my partner and I.
It is a virtual marketplace where users can buy or sell items.
Since there is no server, this version only allows the user to
sell items to an empty marketplace, then buy those items back.
For more details, please read the "MarketplaceFinalMilestone"
document.
