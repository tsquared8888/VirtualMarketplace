# VirtualMarketplace

This project was a school project developed by my partner and I. <br>
It is a virtual marketplace where users can buy or sell items. <br>
Since there is no server, this version only allows the user to<br>
sell items to an empty marketplace, then buy those items back.<br>
For more details, please read the "MarketplaceFinalMilestone"<br>
document.
