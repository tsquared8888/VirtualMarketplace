# VirtualMarketplace

This project was a school project developed by my partner and I. <br>
It is a virtual marketplace where users can buy or sell items. <br>
My partner handled primarily the database related tasks, while I<br> 
handled primarily the GUI and interactions. Since there is no server,<br>
this version only allows the user to sell items to an empty <br>
marketplace, then buy those items back. This project was built on<br>
top of an already existing project, which had an inventory and<br>
crafting system.<br><br>

The scripts I created are BuyItemsMP.cs, NPCInteraction.cs,<br>
SellItem.cs, and VendorSell.cs, as well as necessary edits to<br>
already existing scripts.<br><br>

For more details, please read the "MarketplaceFinalMilestone"<br>
document.
